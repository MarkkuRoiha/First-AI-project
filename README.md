# First-AI-project - predicting household EV system production for the next 24h 

Building the first own AI solution and managing the project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Implementing a small machine learning project that provides hourly prediction of energy provided by the solar panels (a ka EV system) in the household.
Thus it is possible to make educated decisions to put on or off some appliances using electricity (e.g. charging electric car, washing machine, etc.)
Primary target is not necessarily to have a good-looking service, but study and learn about the process of developing ML/AI services including
- Describing the use case, business problem
- Collecting and understanding the data and its quality
- Preparing data
- Modeling i.e. selecting and teaching a model
- Evaluating the accuracy i.e. understanding how much to rely on predictions
- Consider on-going service i.e. updating the model with new data


## Background

Today electricity prices are generally high while fluctuating a lot even within one day highest prices typically during day time and lowest prices during the night. 
The EV system in the household adds an other variable in the formula by producing different amounts of electricity depending on the season, time of day and weather.
It would be interesting to see if ML/AI can provide guidance and decision support to be able to first understand if and how much excess solar energy will be produced
and in later phase even get suggestions when it is most optimal to run certain tasks like charging electric car, use washing machine, etc.

## How is it used?

the process of using the solution tbd. 

code examples:
```
tbd
def main():

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
E.g. 
- whether forecast, 
- production information from inverter (Sofar Solar),
- past weather and national solar energy production information (past data, for teaching and testing the model)
... tbd


## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
